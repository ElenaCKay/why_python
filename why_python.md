### What is OOP?

OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming. It is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. In OOP, objects encapsulate data (attributes) and behaviors (methods), allowing for a modular and reusable approach to software development.

The key principles of OOP are:

- Encapsulation: Encapsulation refers to the bundling of data and related behaviors into objects. It allows for data hiding, where the internal details of an object are hidden and accessed only through defined interfaces, promoting code organization and abstraction.

- Inheritance: Inheritance enables the creation of new classes (derived or child classes) based on existing classes (base or parent classes). Derived classes inherit the attributes and behaviors of their parent classes, promoting code reuse and hierarchical relationships.

- Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables methods to be implemented in different ways in derived classes while providing a consistent interface. Polymorphism enhances code flexibility and extensibility.

- Abstraction: Abstraction focuses on defining essential characteristics and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details. It simplifies complex systems by creating abstract classes or interfaces that provide a high-level view of functionality, allowing developers to work with conceptual models rather than low-level implementation details.
